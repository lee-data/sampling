# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    My Answer: 
    The quality of the sample is reasonably high, given the effort to include diverse demographics across different age groups, cultural backgrounds, and socioeconomic statuses. The use of quota sampling ensures balanced representation by age. However, the sample may not be entirely representative due to certain limitations:

    1. **Geographic Bias**: The survey is limited to Toronto and relies heavily on high-traffic locations, which may overrepresent urban and higher-income populations while underrepresenting rural and lower-income individuals.
    2. **Selection Bias**: Recruitment methods such as convenience and snowball sampling may inadvertently exclude individuals less likely to frequent high-traffic areas.
    3. **Global Representation**: Due to budget constraints, the sample does not include individuals from developing countries or rural areas worldwide, limiting its global applicability.
    4. **Nonresponse Bias**: The reliance on self-selection for participation may skew results, as those with strong music preferences might be more likely to respond.

    Overall, while the sample captures a significant portion of the target population, certain groups remain underrepresented, reducing external validity.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    My Answer: 
    Yes, please see the new survey below. I also re-quote "Purpose of Survey" and "Target Population and Sampling" upfront for readability. 

        ## Survey: Music Taste and Age Relationship
        
        # Purpose of the Survey
              - The aim of this survey is to study the relationship between music taste and age. The study explores whether age impacts music preferences while accounting for cultural exposures, upbringing, and influential social factors. It also investigates perceptions of popular music and changes in preferences over time.
        
        # Target Population and Sampling
              - The target population includes individuals of all age groups, demographics, and backgrounds. The sampling strategy includes proportional quota sampling, with participants recruited from high-traffic areas such as universities, community centers, airports, and supermarkets. Both physical and digital survey options are provided for inclusivity.
        
            1. **Data Collection**:
                    - **Multilingual Support**: Added translations in multiple languages to ensure inclusivity.
                    - **Expanded Outreach**: Introduced kiosks in community centers and aged care facilities, as well as physical mail options.
                    - **Improved Recruitment**: Utilized both online platforms and offline methods to balance accessibility.

            2. **Questionnaire Design**:
                    - Replaced most open-ended questions with dropdown menus or Likert scales to reduce respondent burden and improve data quality.
                    - Added demographic questions about occupation and socioeconomic factors for better subgroup analysis.
                    - Included questions about music streaming platforms and discovery habits to broaden the scope of insights.

            3. **Ethical Considerations**:
                    - Improved confidentiality and transparency by emphasizing optional participation and data anonymity in survey recruitment materials.

            4. **Reasoning**:
                    - These changes address nonresponse bias, measurement error, and ethical concerns while ensuring that data collected is representative and analyzable. The revised survey minimizes errors and enhances the precision of the findings.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    My Answer: 
    
    No, the purpose of the survey could not have been entirely fulfilled through an observational study. Please see reasons below: 

    1. **Behavioral Insights**:

            - Observational studies can only track behavior, such as music played or events attended, but cannot capture subjective preferences, perceptions, or historical influences on music taste.
            - The surveyâ€™s focus on understanding "why" preferences exist (e.g., cultural upbringing, influential persons) necessitates direct input from participants.

    2. **Demographic Correlations**:

            - While observational studies can infer correlations (e.g., genre popularity among age groups), they cannot identify underlying reasons or establish causation.
            - The survey explicitly seeks to explore causal factors like age-related hearing loss or social influences.

    3. **Purpose of Popular Music Evaluation**:
            
            - Observing music consumption patterns in isolation would not reveal participants' subjective opinions about the quality of popular music or how it has changed over time.
