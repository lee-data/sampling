| Data processing                                       | Based on the 2018 General Social Survey Cycle 33 Giving, Volunteering and Participating Public Use Microdata File User Guide ([link](https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=hdl%3A11272.1%2FAB2%2FGBFDYG&form=MG0AV3)):   - **Data Capture**:   . Responses were collected through electronic questionnaires and computer-assisted telephone interviews (CATI).   - **Coding:**   **.** Open-ended responses were coded into pre-existing categories or grouped into new categories when appropriate.   . Standardized classification systems were used for variables like occupation, industry, language, and religion.   . Organisations mentioned in volunteering and giving sections were coded using the International Classification of Nonprofit Organisations (ICNPO)  **- Cleaning**:   . Duplicate records, non-response and out-of-scope records were removed from the dataset.  **- Editing & Imputation**:   . Missing or incorrect data were corrected or imputed using donor imputation.This method involved selecting donor records with similar characteristics to fill in the missing information for a recipient record.   . Imputation was employed for various variables, including personal and family income, volunteer hours, and donation details.  **- Creation of Combined and Derived Variables:**   . In some cases, two or more variables were combined to create a new variable.    **- Confidentiality processing:**   . To protect confidentiality, the data scientists underwent additional processing steps, including donation perturbation and rounding,   | **- Cleaning:**   . The data underwent a rigorous cleaning process. Incomplete responses, duplicates, speeders (those who completed the survey too quickly), straightliners (those who selected the same response for grid questions), and postal code-province mismatches were removed.  - **Duplicate Identification:**   . Duplicates in the CPS were identified based on IP address and demographics: year of birth, gender, education level, employment, religion, and immigration status. In the PES, due to limited demographic variables, duplicates were identified using IP address, province, citizenship status, age, and month of birth. For both surveys, the first response of a duplicate was retained and flagged, while subsequent responses were removed.  - **Flagged Responses:**   . Some responses were flagged for being “inattentive” (those taking over 60 minutes) or “initial duplicates” (took the survey again later, but the initial response was kept). These were not removed but are identified by specific variables in the dataset.  - **Imputation:**   .

This could be a source of error, as the collected data may not accurately reflect the views and opinions of residents in these territories.  **- Non-Response Bias in the PES**  - The targeted response rate for the PES was **50%** of the CPS sample, however, the achieved rate is not specified.   - This means those who chose to participate in the PES might hold different opinions than those who did not respond.   **- Coverage Bias:**   - This was an online survey, which could result in under-representation of certain groups (e.g., people who don’t have access to the internet, or who are not familiar with using computers, etc).   **- Social Desirability Bias:**   - Respondents might be influenced by social desirability bias, leading them to provide answers they perceive as more socially acceptable or favourable, even if these don't accurately reflect their true beliefs or behaviours. This can occur in any survey.   **- Inattentive Respondents:**    - Those taking more than 60 minutes to complete the survey were flagged. While these responses were retained, their inclusion may introduce some level of error if their prolonged engagement reflects inattentiveness or random responding.  **- Initial Duplicate Respondents:**   - Respondents who completed the survey multiple times had their first response retained and flagged. This approach aims to minimise data loss but still acknowledges a potential source of error as the reasons behind repeated participation remain unclear.  | - Exclusion of low-quality sequences;  - Half of insect DNA sequences remained unidentified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Sources of error                                      | **- Sampling error**:   . As with any sample survey, the estimates are subject to sampling error. The data scientists detailed methods for estimating sampling variability using standard errors and coefficients of variation. They also provided guidance on using bootstrap weights for variance estimation.  **- Non-sampling error:**   . These errors can arise at different stages of the survey process, including interviewer errors, respondent errors, and data processing errors.     **. Non-response**:   . Partial-non response: the data scientists used Donor imputation to handle this source of error.   . Complete non-response. This is a source of error because the Households or individuals who did not respond might differ in characteristics from respondents.  **- Measurement error:**   . As with all surveys, errors could arise from respondents misinterpreting questions or inaccuracies during data collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Please see above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | - Limited reference databases;  - Underrepresentation of insectivory due to faecal pellet variability. - Misidentification of prey species - Variability in individual bat behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
