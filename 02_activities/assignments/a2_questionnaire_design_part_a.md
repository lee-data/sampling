# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `# 3: Survey on the Relationship Between Music Taste and Age`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
We aim to study the relationship between music taste and age. We intend to see if there are differences in music tastes between different age groups, and separately, see how music tastes may change with age. In this survey, we will factor in cultural exposures, upbringing exposures, and influential persons' element - to fairly understand to 'what extent' does the 'age' factor influence music tastes, with an emphasis on perceptions of popular music.

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

    Overall Approach: 

    Due to budget and resource constraints, and to make the most of our goal to sample local and international communities, of all demographics (e.g., incomes, genders, ehtnicity, education level, etc.), I would plan to sample: 
    
    1) The University of Toronto community; 
    2) Visitors and staff at high-traffic supermarkets (ie. No Frills, Walmart, LobLaws, etc.); 
    3) Commuters and staff at a local high-traffic train station (ie. Union Station in Toronto); 
    4) Travelers and staff at a high-traffic international airport (ie. Toronto Pearson Airport). 

    As for the implementation plan, I would plan to: 
    - First, lay out financial budget required, and send to prospective sponsors (ie. seeking grants from the university, or financial partnership with Spotify or Youtube Music for example)
    - Post kiosks, giant banners, and QR codes at the selected high-traffic locations (above), with personnel to recruit participants and answer any question. 
    - Post on social media (e.g., the sponsor's Instagram or Facebook) 
    - Send emails to the University of Toronto community (provided the school gives consent and share the emails list) 
    - Post at the school's residential colleges and community bulletins (provided the school gives consent)

    I aim collect the following thresholds for each of the age group: 
    1) Teenagers (between 13 - 19 years old): 100
    2) Young adults (between 20 - 29 years old): 200
    3) Adults (between 30 - 39 years old): 200
    4) Early middle age (between 40 - 49 years old): 100
    5) Middle age (between 50 - 59 years old): 100
    6) Late Middle age (between 60 - 69 years old): 100
    7) Elderly (70 years and above): 100 

    I believe these sample sizes can be achieved, because: 
    - Toronto Union Station transports > *300,000* people everyday. (Source: https://www.groundedlifetravel.com/toronto-union-station-a-complete-guide/?form=MG0AV3) 
    - Toronto International Pearson Airport has about *35,000* passengers everyday. (Source: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221208/dq221208e-eng.htm?form=MG0AV3 - where it mentions they have about 13 million passengers in 2020, which by calculation would be about 35,000 people everyday). 
    - Busy supermarket stores like Loblaws and No Frills may have about *1,500 - 3,000* visitors everyday (by rough estimates).
    - The University of Toronto community has about 800,000 people including enrolled students (about 100,000), faculty and staff members (about 16,500) and alumni (about 680,000). (Source: https://www.utoronto.ca/about-u-of-t/quick-facts?form=MG0AV3)

    
    I plan to conduct *multistage sampling*, beginning with *Convenience sampling* and *Snowball sampling* for the initial data gathering, followed by *Stratified sampling* for each age group.  

    Below is the detailed breakdown.     

 # Target Population

    The target population includes individuals across various age groups, spanning from teenagers to older adults.  

# Sampling Frame

    Due to budget and resource constraints, and to make the most of our goal to sample local and international communities, of all demographics (e.g., incomes, genders, ehtnicity, education level, etc.), we plan to sample: 

    - *University of Toronto Community:* about 800,000 people
        - Current Students (undergraduate and graduate): about 100,000 people
        - Faculty & Staff Members: about 16,500 people
        - Alumni: about 680,000 people

        Reason: I aim to capture data from both the local community and the international community (e.g., overseas students, overseas alumni). 

    - *Wider Community:*

        - Visitors & staff at Union Station: about 300,000 passengers everyday. 
            
            Reason: I aim to capture data from the local GTA commuters, as well as visitors from overseas and other provinces
        
        - Visitors & staff at Toronto International Pearson Airport: about 35,000 passengers everyday 
        
            Reason: I aim to capture data from international communities (including expats, overseas students, and refugees) as well as Canadians who travel internationally. 
        
        - Visitors & staff at 3 major supermarkets (Loblaws Carlton, No Frills, Metro): about 4,500 to 9,000 visitors everyday 
            Reason: I aim to capture data from the local Toronto downtown community, and a few visitors from overseas and other provinces. 


# Sampling Units: 

The sampling units are *individual respondents* within the target population.


# Fixed Sample Sizes for Each Age Group

    1) Teenagers (between 13 - 19 years old): 100
    2) Young adults (between 20 - 29 years old): 200
    3) Adults (between 30 - 39 years old): 200
    4) Early middle age (between 40 - 49 years old): 100
    5) Middle age (between 50 - 59 years old): 100
    6) Late Middle age (between 60 - 69 years old): 100
    7) Elderly (70 years and above): 100

# Observational Units: 

The observational units are the *individual participants who complete the survey*.

Your 5-10 question survey:
